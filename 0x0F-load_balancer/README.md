Load balancer will distribute the work-load of your system to multiple individual systems, or group of systems to to reduce the amount of load on an individual system, which in turn increases the reliability, efficiency and availability of your enterprise application or website.


ADVANTAGES OF LOAD BALANCING
Reduced the work-load on an individual server.
Large amount of work done in same time due to concurrency.
Increased performance of your application because of faster response.
No single point of failure. In a load balanced environment, if a server crashes the application is still up and served by the other servers in the cluster.
When appropriate load balancing algorithm is used, it brings optimal and efficient utilization of the resources, as it eliminates the scenario of some serverâ€™s resources are getting used than others.
Scalability: We can increase or decrease the number of servers on the fly without bringing down the application
Load balancing increases the reliability of your enterprise application
Increased security as the physical servers and IPs are abstract in certain cases.




On a high level, there are two types of load balancers, which implements different types of scheduling algorithms and routing mechanisms.
Software load balancer
Hardware load balancer
