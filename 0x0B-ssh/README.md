a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients." This architecture is called the clientâ€“server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services," such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients or performing computations for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. 
Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.
